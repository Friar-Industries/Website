            <p>This first Repo was only used during our First Qualifier. In this repo we attempted to develop an autonomus using a custom module and the goBilda Pinpoint Odoemtry computer. While our module worked it had a large margin of error and was only good while facing forwards. Due to these limitations we upgraded to a new repo that used the roadrunner pinpoint quickstart.</p>
